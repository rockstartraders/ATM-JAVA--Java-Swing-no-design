Java ATM created using Java Swing ( Plain and no design )

If you need it for a project or assignment please feel free to download it and paste it to Netbeans project folder and design it with your liking. 



Note : 

1. The Database file is included that is the " ATM.sqlite " but for it to work a lower version of Mozilla Firefox is needed which I also include.
2. Please ensure that the Firefox update is not On.
3. Please download the sqlite addon here:   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/   
4. Just make sure to update the path for the sound files ( for the Menu Form )  and database for it to work. 
     

Thank You.
